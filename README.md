# Overview

This program is a simple sudoku generator. It functions by producing a legal, complete grid, then removing values from the grid until firther removals would prevent the puzzle from having a unique solution. I wrote this program in the hopes that it would teach me the basics of Erlang.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in Erlang in Visual Studio. Copilot was used to find helpful information and documentation from the sources below.

# Useful Websites

* [Official Erlang Documentation](erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/index.html)
* [Wikipedia's Erlang Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language))
* [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/erlang)

# Future Work

If I come back to this project, It would be interesting to add:

* Difficulty settings
* A more robust algorithm to check for solutions
